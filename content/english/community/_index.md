    title: "**What the heck is a discord?**" 
    content: "Great question. This section was written by an older organizer at BCBUD who had to learn what a discord channel is. She still isn't 100% sure, but here's what she's learned:
    At a glance, Discord is a forum where anyone admitted is able to live chat with other participants. Discord forums are usually centred around a common interest like a college course or videogame. It's pretty fast moving, which is why we run multiple channels: A BCBUD members channel for dedicated discussion around our organizational affairs and industry news, a general chat for all things cannabis, and an educational channel for discussion on the latest in cannabis science."

fund:
    title: "Educational Fund"
    content: "Education and good training is essential to excelling in the cannabis industry, but educational opportunities are limited and can be hard to acquire. We want to increase access to basic educational opportunities for all cannabis workers, and are assessing these opportunities in order to launch an educational fund in late 2021 that will purchase courses for cannabis workers who are BCBUD members. Check back later for more!
    The best way to access additional training in the meantime is by fighting for it through collective bargaining with a union. Beyond that, we suggest keeping tabs on [Leafly News]() for a fun rundown on emerging science!"
