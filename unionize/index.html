        <h2 class="mb-2 font-size-40">What is a union?</h2>
        <p>A union is an organization that works with employees to address problems at work. Not unlike hiring a law firm to represent you in negotiations, a union will have lawyers, professional negotiators, market researchers, communications departments and other staff whose job is to get you a good, legally binding contract.</p>
        <p>Unions act as a vehicle for workers to advance their interests as a group and improve their working conditions. With a union, you and your coworkers can shape the terms of your work (e.g. wages, schedules, uniforms, benefits) by creating a legally binding collective agreement.</p>

        <p>Unions act as a vehicle for workers to advance their interests as a group and improve their working conditions. With a union, you and your coworkers can shape the terms of your work (e.g. wages, schedules, uniforms, benefits) by creating a legally binding collective agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 col-11 glass roundsides">
        <h2 class="mb-2 font-weight-bold">You have the right to form a Union!</h2>
        <p>Unionizing is inherently stressful, but <strong>in B.C. you have enshrined rights to pursue union representation</strong>. An employer may not threaten to lay off workers, to close their store, or to declare bankruptcy in order to dissuade union certification. Doing so is illegal.</p>
        <p>Moreover, <strong>your employer may not fire or reprimand you for trying to unionize</strong>, and if you believe they have done so either directly or under the guise of another issue, you may be able to get your job back. Contact your union representative right away if this is happening to you and be sure to write everything down with dates, participants and what was said as soon as it happens.</p>

        <p>A general guide to unionizing:</p>

        <span class="item mt-3">1</span>
        <p class="mt-3">Talk to your coworkers. Find one or two coworkers to discreetly talk with about unionizing. Only discuss unions outside of the workplace or during unpaid time. Be prepared to field questions and actively listen to your coworkers if they have concerns. A union is formed both by and for one another.</p>
        <p>When you begin campaigning, it pays to be discreet. It is unadvised to discuss the union openly at your workplace until you receive a certification vote date. This is because once your boss is aware and is put on notice, this leaves your campaign vulnerable to discouraging tactics for a longer period of time. Start by only talking with people you trust, and considering using code words with each other that you can use at work on the days that feel more difficult than others. Having a union is sort of like having a lawyer, but you need your coworkers’ approval to hire them.</p>

        <span class="item mt-3">2</span>
        <p class="mt-3">Research your local unions. When you’ve picked one or two, call to ask for a meeting. If possible, be prepared to answer the following questions:</p>
        <ul class="buds-list">
          
          <li>How many employees are in your department?</li>
          
          <li>How many stores does your employer have in the region?</li>
          
          <li>What do your coworkers think about the employer?</li>
          
          <li>What are the wages and benefits for your job?</li>
          
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-5 col-12 glass roundsides">
        <p class="mt-4">When choosing a union, don’t be thrown off by their name. Many unions today represent more than one industry! Some major options in BC include</p>
        <ol class="gradient-list">
          
          <li class="mb-2 font-weight-bold">BC Government Employees Union (BCGEU): (250) 388-9948</li>

        <p class="mt-3">Sign a membership card. These cards signify that the union may help you build up a campaign going forward, and include space to sign your name, contact info and signature. Cards are confidential and your employer will not see it. If you already have a group of coworkers on board, ask them to sign membership cards, or help by talking to 3 or 4 other staff members they trust about the reasons for signing. Do not sign cards while on shift! Once they have been signed, return them to your union representative as soon as you can.</p>

        <span class="item mt-3">4</span>
        <p class="mt-3">Build your campaign with the help of your union rep! Slowly open the discussion of unionizing with other coworkers, but never discuss the union during paid working hours and be sure that you can trust the people you speak to. Try meeting with coworkers before or after work, or offer to meet them on their day off. Be careful with text messages or facebook messages sent to people that might not be on board.</p>

        <span class="item mt-3">5</span>
        <p class="mt-3">Apply for certification! After at least 45% of employees have signed cards the union will apply to the BC Labour Relations Board to certify the union (a step towards making the union official).</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>One practical way to support your coworkers is to establish a group chat where they can provide updates as needed. This might give you an avenue to vent or have a laugh; Binding your coworkers together at this time is essential to winning your campaign. The vote takes place at each employment location that has applied for membership. A labour board official will be present to count votes and certify the results, they usually share the results right away.</p>

        <p class="mt-3">Hold the certification vote (this gives the union the right to represent you at negotiations.) You need a majority of all bargaining unit employees to vote in favour in order to win certification. Voting is confidential.</p>
        <p>Your bargaining unit is the group of people the union will represent in negotiations, who perform similar functions in the workplace, and who do not have firing/hiring power over each other (i.e. managers, owners).</p>

        <p class="mt-3">Negotiate. When your union has been certified, they will begin preparation for negotiations. This may take a few months, but eventually you will sit down with your union representative, your employer and their counsel to hash out a collective bargaining agreement.</p>

        <p class="mt-3 mb-5">Ratify! When the agreement has been ratified (voted on) by the employees and accepted, the terms of the contract come into effect. The employer and the union will agree to renegotiate the terms within a set amount of time, usually 1, 2 or 5 years.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading text-white">What information will I need?</h2>
        <p>It’s a good idea to store essential information while preparing to unionize. This could include: Your coworkers contact information, your <strong>work contract, paystubs, schedules, employee manuals, emails from the employer, a copy of your anti-harassment policy, and a copy of the benefits plan</strong>.</p>
        <p>You might also find yourself building documents during your union campaign. These might include: A grievance list with input from your coworkers, a list of contract proposals to remedy grievances, coworkers schedules, copies of incident logs if relevant to your grievance list, and more.</p>

      <div class="col-md-10 align-self-center text-center text-md-left glass roundsides">
        <h2 class="subheading text-white">Where do my union dues go?</h2>
        <p>Contacting the union, building your campaign and negotiating your first contract is free. After your first Collective Bargaining Agreement (new employment contract) is ratified, the union will take a 1-2% deduction off of every paycheque. You will usually get more back from collective bargaining in both monetary and non-monetary items than you lose to union dues. Union dues are also 100% tax-deductible.</p>
        <p>Union dues are collected in order to pay your union representatives, your union legal departments, to build up public campaigns, to host meetings and training sessions for bargaining units, shop stewards, and union members, to support striking workers and to perform market research that helps prepare union contracts, and much more.</p>
