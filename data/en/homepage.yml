  q_one: "What is BCBUD?"
  a_one: "BC Budtenders United is a brand new worker oriented organization run by cannabis workers for cannabis workers!"
  q_two: "Why is it?"
  a_two: "Our goal is to help cannabis workers get a leg up in a brand new industry that is entirely staffed by those 19+. Budtenders and other cannabis workers must hold government certifications to be eligible for work. We believe **any work that requires certifications to perform should be living wage work**."
  a_two_one: "(*In fact, we at BCBUD believe all work merits a living wage, but for the sake of this organization we are just focused on cannabis workers* ;)"
  a_two_two: "The legal cannabis industry is thriving thanks to the efforts of marginalized communities past and present. Many cannabis workers in BC are members of these marginalized communities, and as such may face greater barriers to acquiring meaningful, liveable work."
  q_three: "What will BCBUD do?"
  a_three: "To combat exploitation of cannabis workers, we believe greater access to **Educational Training** is needed. Additional training may provide cannabis workers with leverage to move into higher paid cannabis industry work in the future. As such, we will be launching an **Educational Fund** in late 2021 that will purchase training for approved members."
  a_three_one: "Another way you can improve your work environment is collective bargaining (as in, bargaining as a team). If you want to learn more about unionizing and collective bargaining, check out our [Unionize 101](/unionize) guide, or check back about our Educational Fund later this year."
  q_four: "What else can I do?"
  a_four: "Venting is a good place to start! That's why we're excited to invite any *non-management* cannabis workers/budtenders to join our [Discord server](/community#discord). Get in touch with other cannabis workers in BC, discuss common issues, funny occurrences, frustrations with legislation (looking at you, window coverings) and anything else related to cannabis. The forum is 19+, you can request access above."
  a_four_one: "You can also consider joining our membership. Members may want to become board members, participate in public petitions or actions, consult on federal, provincial and municipal cannabis regulation, and be invited to participate in panels and events for cannabis workers."
  a_four_two: "If you want to talk about issues in your workplace, reach out through our [Need Support](/contact) page."
